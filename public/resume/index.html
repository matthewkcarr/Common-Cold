My first task was to allow Dr. Ingham to be able to edit his website.  I used PHP and ITX templates to enable him to post News messages, upload files, add new bio information, change pictures, etc... In general I made a small content management system. After finishing the web project we started working on a stutter treatement program for which I mapped out a <a style="font-size:80%" href="requirements.rtf">requirements analysis</a>.</p>

We used CVS for release control, and I worked with C, javascript, and learned to manage cron jobs as well. I liked the fact that I was able to work with open source technologies.</p>

They make currency, bank notes, phone cards, and passports. I worked in their research and development department on two seperate tasks. I studied these <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://www.cardwerk.com/smartcards/smartcard_standard_ISO7816.aspx">documents</a> (ISO 7816), and developed an application for the integrated circuits on the Thai passport in the <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaCard">JavaCard</a> language. By the end of my three months there I discovered that IBM hadn't worked out all the kinks on their JCOP 31 chip.  It couldn't perform RSA encryption when operating on wireless power. I finished the passport appliation, worked on my Thai language skills, and read/wrote about <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID">RFID</a>. If you'd like more details on what I did you can <a style="font-size:80%" href="accomplished.rtf">read my week by week details</a> - the bottom of the document would probably be the most intersting for anyone that doesn't want to read about JCOP's and RFID's.</p>

At IC I created a spiffy website in flash (sorry I don't have a link for you), made a PHP driven site for a Japanese Professor, and I wrote <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://shg.ic.ucsb.edu/projects/view_project/?project_id=000215">tutorials</a> and taught workshops on Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Microsoft Access, Sun One, Dreamweaver, Quickbooks, and perl CGI capabilities.</p>

My friend Steve owned this label called <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://ww.dimmak.com">dimmak</a>, and with his connections (and a growing word of mouth about the place) I was able to promote concerts for many wonderful bands hailing from all of the world - (Japan, Scotland, Brazil).  I would listen to thousands of tapes and CD's that were sent to my house, find the awesome bands, email them to find out a date they wanted, make a flyer, notify the mailing list, contact newspapers, set up the PA, and collect money at the door. Some of the bands that played at my house are even getting mass appeal now. Eg. <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://www.younggodrecords.com/prodtype.asp?PT_ID=71">Devendra Banhart</a>, <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://www.againstme.net/">Against Me!</a> ... and a few others. </p>

				<p id="body">Besides working I've had some interview coding projects. These are the most interesting of them that I've come accross. The first is a Ruby on Rails application that requires you to take a page of questions and possible answers and turn it into a functional questionnaire. The other is a C++ project, that for one will handle large Integer's with some decimal data - among other things.

				<p id="body">Composing music is a passion of mine. So being able to work with audio on a computer holds particular interst to me. And since I hate to pay for things, I decided to start using <a style="font-size:80%;" href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA</a>.  I became familiar with writing my own wav reading code, and then started to develop a bit of GUI to use with a LADSPA vocoder plugin using QT Designer. </p><p>(<a href="realExamples.txt">sample code</a>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="vocoder.jpg">screenshot</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="ladspaGUI.tar.gz">all the source</a>)

				<p id="body">I love the linux world. I've used three distro's so far including Mandrake, Fedora, and Gentoo, of which Gentoo is my favorite alongside KDE.  I've even dirtied my hands digging through the kernel and making LKM's (loadable kernel modules). I appended an IP address to every process running in the system so that any kind of READ or WRITE system call would have an 'owner' who could be checked for security clearance at the time of the system call.</p> <p>(<a href="loadableModule.txt">sample code</a>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="editKernel.tar.gz">all the source</a>)

				<p id="body">Human computer interaction fascinates me, and I had the chance to develop an application with the sole aim of applying concepts like direct manipulation, flexibility for the user, <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/08/19/fitts_law/">fitt's law</a>, giving informative feedback - etc. </p> <p>(<a href="digital_example.txt">sample code</a>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="digitalShot.jpg">screenshot</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="digitalClassroom.tar.gz">all the source</a>)

				<p id="body">I find many experimental and underground films fascinating. My roomate started making his own films. I thought they were great, and other people should be able to see them.  So I got the idea to make a website that enabled people to upload and view clips of homegrown films/documentaries/whatever! ) People can select stuff they think they like, and then I'll send them a DVD (unless i get bandwidth & a whole  array of cool computers - [and not just my 5 year old man serving as my personal computer & server. ha!] ) of their selections so that they can view it, and put it on public access for others to see as well. I acquainted myself with <a style="font-size:80%" href="http://www.mamboserver.com">mambo</a> and added my own film component! Say hooray for open source! (please note that i don't condone the use of PHP -especially without templates- i just wanted to get this done fast). The <a style="font-size:80%" href="InitialDesignScenarios.rtf">User Scenario</a> presents the idea in a clearer fashion.</p>(<a href="http://www.televisiontakeover.com">television takeover</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="php_films_example.txt">some source</a>)</p> 
				<p id="body">Two other things that are kind of interesting that I've done - one) a MIPS disassembler - reads binary assembly language, executes the instructions, and then simulates the processor caching process. two) my own shell!  i like to call it MIANS - 'Matt is a nerd shell'.</p> <p>(<a href="mips_example.txt">snippet of mips</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="disassemble.tar.gz">full mips</a>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="shell_proj.txt">snippet of MIANS</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="mattshell.tar.gz">complete MIANS</a>)
