In this project I deveoped a UI for complete control of a "DIGITAL CLASSROOM".  You had to be able to take control of students computers,pipe computer screens to different projectors, turn on/off projectors and lights... etc. I arranged the 20 computers into rows like the class room, so all of the rows give dialog box with the numbers and names of the computers in that row, and the available options. The lights and projectors are directly manipulatable - clicking a light makes the switch go up, clicking the projector illuminates the image. (I changed my desktop settings just recently so the FONT size is off.
