	    What is Restore&apos;s purpose?
	  </p>
	  <p class="pcontent">Aiming to offer the first residential facility for women escaping enslavement by the sex trade in New York, Restore hopes to provide a long-term recovery program in New York City to women who have been victimized by the sex trade through trafficking and prostitution.  The ultimate benefit of this initiative is to provide hope, healing, ongoing support and the alleviation of poverty to an extremely traumatized and greatly underserved population.</p>
	  <p class="header">
	    Mission Statement 
	  </p>
	  <p class="pcontent">
	    Restore is a Christian non-profit organization serving women enslaved by the sex trade by providing safe housing and specialized services to restore their physical, emotional, and spiritual health.

	    The Underground Sex Trade 
	  </p>
	  <p class="pcontent">
	    Prostitution and sex trafficking are rampant in New York City.  According to the United States Department of State, New York City&apos;s JFK airport is a major port of entry and transit point for trafficking of persons.  The sex industries in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens range from street prostitution to strip clubs, peep booth shows, massage parlors, bars, private apartments, and escort services. Contrary to popular belief, a woman does not simply decide to be a prostitute.  Rather, she often finds herself in this situation as a result of economic deprivation, coercion of some sort and a history of sexual abuse.<br/><br/>
	    Victims of prostitution and sex trafficking are vulnerable to succumbing to a host of psychological problems and physical ills, such as acute anxiety, depression, suicidality, early pregnancies, forced abortions, sexually transmitted infections and reproductive diseases (ECPAT-USA, 2002).      <br/> <br/>
	    While many women may want to escape this life, there are few resources that would enable them to do so.  As a result, there is a great need for effective services for prostituted and trafficked women in New York City.  Currently, there is not a single Christian or secular organization holistically serving this population in Manhattan or the surrounding boroughs. There is no residential haven specifically for women escaping the sex industry.<br/><br/>
	    While organizations exist in New York City that are working hard to end trafficking and prostitution of women and youth, none is focused on providing long-term aftercare services to these women such as shelter, counseling, job training, and a way out of prostitution. Rather, most of the current efforts are directed toward providing legal services and advocacy with New York City and State.

	  <p class="pcontent">The idea for Restore began in the spring of 2004 when three friends from New York City felt called to find practical ways to serve and help victims of sex trafficking in the city.  The following August, Restore&apos;s founders began training in Vancouver, Canada with Servants Anonymous World Services, an organization with a track record of success serving this population.  In 2006, Restore was granted 501(c)(3) status by the Internal Revenue Service and subsequently was able to begin fundraising.  In 2007, the Board was expanded to seven directors, and several successful fundraising events were held.  The Board hired an Executive Director in 2008.  The Board&apos;s primary focus for 2009 is to ensure the successful pilot of its case management program and raise financial resources so that we will be able to secure our own residence in 2010, in addition to other initiatives including developing Restore&apos;s operational infrastructure, program development, and Board development.</p>

	Restore is extremely excited to report that we are currently collaborating with the <a href="http://www.nyawc.org">New York Asian Women&apos;s Center</a>, a long-established, New York-based not-for-profit organization that for over 25 years has been helping battered women overcome domestic violence and govern their own lives, free of abuse.  Restore&apos;s plan is to partner with this organization&apos;s new special initiative called &quot;Project Free&quot; to serve victims of human trafficking. This collaboration will allow Restore to begin assisting the NYAWC with case management and other support services (ESL, vocational training and job placement, recreational activities, etc.) in the winter of 2008.  Restore aims to begin piloting our residential program under the NYAWC by fall of 2009.

	  Restore aims to provide a home to women escaping the sex industry is the most treasured and primary aspect of our program.  When a woman escapes prostitution or trafficking, she is immediately in need of safe housing.  In addition to the fundamental provision of food, housing and clothing, Restore&apos;s program is unique for four specific reasons:  (1) accountability, (2) spiritual guidance, (3) modeling healthy daily living and (4) total reintegration back into society.<br/> <br/>

	  The accountability provided by Restore will hold each woman accountable for the goals that she and Restore staff and volunteers have agreed upon together in working towards her total restoration.  The gap in services for sex trafficked women currently in the New York City is not only the lack of housing specific for this population, but an overarching umbrella organization that holds trafficked women accountable to their goals as well as streamlining the services provided. <br/><br/>

	  The spiritual component is a vital and integral part of Restore providing total restoration to these women.  We believe that Jesus is the ultimate healer.  The women will be invited to receive the healing of Christ, though we will not mandate that participants practice Christian disciplines, specifically, attending Bible Studies and 12-Step Spiritual Recovery Groups offered in the evenings and weekends by staff, Live-In Servants, Board members and volunteers.  Staff and Board members have full legal right to pray with and over participants when verbal permission is granted by the participant.  The women in the program will also be invited to church on Sundays with Live-In Servants and volunteers, preferably to a church that holds services in the native language of the participant. <br/><br/>  

	  Modeling healthy daily living is a day-to-day learning and growth process whereby the participants will learn and see firsthand what it means to live in Christian community.  Participants will learn the principles of developing a daily structure/routine that incorporates sharing, conflict resolution, daily personal and household cleaning, maintaining a curfew and learning mutual trust and respect for others.<br/> <br/>     

	  The goal for each woman in the program is for her to be fully reintegrated into society and to be completely self-sufficient after 3 to 6 years in the program. The increased and multiple needs of this population (drug addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, disease, cutting, depression, AIDS, etc.) require a higher concentration of care over a longer period of time.  Restore is committed to walking alongside each woman during her difficult road to recovery. <br/><br/> 

	  The programs and services Restore seeks to provide will include:<br/><br/>

	    <ul>
	      <li>A safe and secure living environment where participants will live together in apartments and homes owned or rented exclusively by Restore throughout the city in order to enhance their recovery</li>
	      <li>An off-site day program incorporating instruction in academics, GED preparation, computer training, parenting and social and interpersonal skills</li>
	      <li>Job training skills and on-the-job experience through business cooperatives</li>
	      <li>By providing a stable, nurturing and long-term living environment, Restore will empower sexually exploited women to address the source of their pain, to heal and to make positive changes in their lives.</li>

	    <small>Using vérité and intimate interviews, this expose of human trafficking follows thirteen and fourteen year-old American girls as they are seduced, abused, and sold on New York’s streets by pimps, and treated as adult criminals by police. The film identifies hope for these girls in the organization GEMS (Girls Education and Mentoring Services), a recovery center founded and run by Rachel Lloyd, herself a survivor of sexual exploitation. This unprecedented access to girls and pimps will change the way law enforcement, the media, and society as a whole look at sexual exploitation, street prostitution and human trafficking that is happening right in our own backyard.
